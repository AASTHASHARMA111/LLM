# LLM

A Large Language Model (LLM) is an advanced artificial intelligence (AI) model trained on massive amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like text. LLMs are built using deep learning techniques, primarily transformers, and can perform tasks like:

âœ… Text generation (chatbots, content writing)
âœ… Text summarization
âœ… Code generation (like GitHub Copilot)
âœ… Machine translation
âœ… Question answering

ðŸ›  How LLMs Work:
Pre-training â€“ The model learns language patterns by training on large datasets (books, articles, internet text).
Fine-tuning â€“ It is refined on specific tasks or domains to improve performance.
Prompt Engineering â€“ Users interact with the model using prompts to guide responses.
âš¡ Popular LLMs:
GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) â€“ OpenAI (e.g., GPT-4, ChatGPT)
LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) â€“ Meta
Gemini â€“ Google
Claude â€“ Anthropic
Mistral â€“ Open-source LLM
